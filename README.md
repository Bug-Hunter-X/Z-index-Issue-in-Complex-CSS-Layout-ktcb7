# z-index Issue in Complex CSS Layout

This repository demonstrates a peculiar issue related to the `z-index` property in CSS.  Despite setting a high `z-index` value for an element, it consistently remains behind other elements. The layout incorporates nested divs, flexbox, and grid for a complex structure.  The issue is consistent across major browsers and doesn't seem to be resolved by typical troubleshooting steps.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code, while `solution.css` offers a possible fix. The challenge lies in understanding why the straightforward `z-index` approach fails in this specific context.
