The issue stems from the interaction of `z-index` with the stacking context.  In the original CSS, the parent elements lack a defined stacking context, so the `z-index` is not correctly applied across parent-child relationships. 

The solution involves creating a stacking context for the parent element using properties like `position: relative` and ensuring the z-index value is correctly set at the appropriate level within the stacking context. In the updated `solution.css`, this has been implemented, resolving the layering problem.

```css
/* solution.css */
.parent {
  position: relative; /* Creates stacking context */
}
.element-on-top {
  z-index: 10;
  position: relative;
}
```
