The CSS code has an unusual error where the `z-index` property is not working as expected for an element that should be on top.  The element is styled correctly, but it remains behind other elements, even with a higher `z-index` value. This happens consistently across different browsers. The code includes multiple nested divs and uses flexbox and grid layouts.
